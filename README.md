# Thoth Tech Handbook

This is where we'll try to share about Thoth Tech, the company, our values, our culture and our processes.
It's a central guide to understand more about what we believe in and how we run the company. As part of
our value of being transparent, the handbook is open to the world and we welcome feedback. Please create
a pull request to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Please use issues to ask questions.
