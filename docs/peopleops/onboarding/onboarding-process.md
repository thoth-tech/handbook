# Onboarding process

We are so excited you're here and look forward to setting you up for success.

Onboarding is incredibly important at Thoth Tech. We don't expect you to hit the
ground running from day one.

We highly recommend taking at least one full day for onboarding. Please feel
free to participate in your team's work in the first two weeks, but don't feel
like you are under heavy pressure. We are here to help.

The onboarding process for the new team member is self-driven and self-learning,
whilst also remaining as asynchronous as possible. It has been developed with
three dimensions in mind, namely:

- Organisational Onboarding
- Technical Onboarding
- Social Onboarding

## Accounts & Access

- [ ] Submit the [onboarding form](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/81fef3a6-72aa-4648-a763-de824aeafb7d/_djb2_msteams_prefix_1382414451?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3Anull%2C%22channelId%22%3A%2219%3AQfx_STHU90OsVYBHVYKhsRQ5gmEe0s9Q6kOpBf6bli81%40thread.tacv2%22%7D&groupId=0e15669c-3f66-49aa-b023-640fe1dda2e0&tenantId=d02378ec-1688-46d5-8540-1c28b5f470f6)

- [ ] Ping a person in the leadership team to add you in the
      [Thoth Tech organisation](https://github.com/thoth-tech) on GitHub. Being

      effectively.

## Company

- [ ] Thoth Tech charter helps to steer the ways we work and is a living document.
      It is documented, refined and revised based on lessons learned in the course of doing business.
      Please familiarise yourself with our [Charter](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/company/charter.md).

## Products

We have three products at Thoth Tech: OnTrack, SplashKit and DreamBig. Depending
on which team you are working with, you are expected to have a good level of
understanding about the product and how to set it up. Please follow the
applicable product onboarding below.

## Social

Starting in a new team can be overwhelming, how about schedule some calls with your team members. The Leadership
team would also love to chat. There's no need to ask people if it's okay to schedule a call first. Schedule a
meeting using Schedule Assistant in the Outlook calendar. Be sure to introduce yourself in the invite.
