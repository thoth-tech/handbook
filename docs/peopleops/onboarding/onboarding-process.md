# Onboarding process

We are so excited you're here and look forward to setting you up for success.

Onboarding is incredibly important at Thoth Tech. We don't expect you to hit the ground running from
day one.

We highly recommend taking at least one full day for onboarding. Please feel free to participate in
your team's work in the first two weeks, but don't feel like you are under heavy pressure. We are
here to help.

The onboarding process for the new team member is self-driven and self-learning, whilst also
remaining as asynchronous as possible. It has been developed with three dimensions in mind, namely:

- Organisational Onboarding
- Technical Onboarding
- Social Onboarding

## Product lead

- Get ownership of all Ms team channels and the private sub channels, github repo, miro board, trello etc (have read and write acess)
- Delete unused channels. Make sure all the documents under the deleted channel are moved/stored in either github or transferred to the relevant new channel.
- Create a onboarding form or make a copy of previous trimester's form (Get student Github ID among other things)
- Provide delivery leads with their team member name, target grade, github username so that delivery leads can add these people into github and Ms channels
- Educate the juniors about products and subprojects. You can do that my running workshop, blog post, one to one sessions etc
- Book your weekly leadership meeting.

a call first. Schedule a meeting using Schedule Assistant in the Outlook calendar. Be sure to
introduce yourself in the invite.
