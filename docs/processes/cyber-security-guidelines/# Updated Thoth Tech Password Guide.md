# Thoth Tech Password Guide
## Purpose
This guide has been created to help Thoth Tech members create a positive, secure password culture. It does not aim to be comprehensive and offers general advice on password management.

## Background
A password aids in preventing unauthorised access, but if it is revealed, it is no longer an effective defence. As Chaudhary (2022) mentioned, “Cybersecurity plays a crucial role within the field of the digital world. Securing information and data has become one of the most critical challenges in the present day”.
Every organisation must have documented Security Guidelines to mitigate the risks in this ever-evolving threat landscape.
It is necessary to ensure each person is whom they claim to be (authentication), usually by checking the user ID and password they enter. It allows them to access only the data they’re allowed to use (authorisation). 
Instructions
Thoth tech requires that passwords adhere to the following factors:
- Passwords should include a variety of symbols. They should have at least one number, both uppercase and lowercase letters, and one or more special characters
- It should not contain your personal information — specifically, your real name, username, student ID, etc.
- Reset admin passwords every 180 days. For example, Admin OnTrack accounts Admin Splashkit accounts, DreamBig admin accounts etc.
- Passwords cannot be used from the previous five passwords.      
- All online and desktop accounts must change at least every six months. For example, GitHub, Teams, Trello, Miro, DockerHub, LucidChart 
- The password should be changed in the case of a potential threat or suspected unauthorised access.

The following passwords are discouraged:
- Easy-to-guess passwords, especially the phrase "password."
- A string of numbers or letters like “1234” or “abcd.”
- A series of characters appear sequentially on the keyboard, like “@#$%^&.”
- A user’s given name, the name of a spouse or partner, or other names
- The user’s phone number or license plate number, anybody’s birth date, or additional information easily obtained about a user (e.g., address or alma mater)
- The same character typed multiple times, like “zzzzzz.”
- Words that can be found in a dictionary
- Default or suggested passwords, even if they seem strong
- Usernames or host names used as passwords
- Passwords that form a pattern by incrementing a number or character at the beginning or end

## Account Management:
This policy aims to establish a precise procedure for setting up, managing, and deleting accounts that permit access to Thoth Tech's information. In Thoth Tech, we use Miro, Trello, Microsoft Teams, Docker hub, lucid chart etc. The top system administrator, like the leaders, has control and management roles in creating, editing, and maintaining group access. Credentials dedicated to users' access are identified, and data security bridging is controlled.
