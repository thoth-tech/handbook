## Formatting

### Headings

Headings should be clear and concise. All content should relate to the heading or provide links to other information sources.

Article headings should not be in a question format.

Use h1 (#) for article headings.

### Subheadings

Subheadings are used to highlight a specific paragraph or area of content. All content should apply to this specific subheading.

Avoid multi-tiered subheadings, use a maximum of three layers as a guide. If you need more than three layers, consider creating a separate article.

Subheadings can be in a question format where appropriate.

Use h2 (##) or h3 (###) for subheadings. Choice depends on the layer.

### Notes

Information that is outside the scope of the content should be placed as a note if it necessary for the reader to understand.

Content within a note should be separate from the main content, short, and to the point. A link to more information can be provided within the note section

### Hyperlinks

Consider using hyperlinks (links) to ensure all information is relevant only to the article at hand.

When an article references information that is out of scope, the reader can be linked to other information sources.

For example:

One reference for Australian spelling is the [Macquarie Dictionary](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/).

### Lists

The sentence leading into a list should eend in a colon (:).
If each item in the list is a full sentence, capitalise the first letter and end each item with a full stop.
Otherwise, if the items are fragements of a sentence, each item should start in lowercase. Use a full stop at the end of the last item.

#### Unordered/bullet list

An unordered list should be used when the order of the items is not important.

To create an unordered list, you should:

- end the leading sentence with a colon
- end each item with no punctuation mark
- not use a capital letter or full stop if the list items are not full sentences
- nnd the last item with a full stop.

To create unordered list items in markdown, use a dash (-).

#### Ordered/numbered list

An ordered list should be used when the order of the items is important, for example, step-by-step instructions.

Follow these steps to create an ordered list:

1. You should always use a colon at the end of the leading sentence.
2. Please put list items in the right order.
3. Check that items which are full sentences have capital letters and full stops.

To create an ordered list in markdown, use a number followed by a full stop (1.).

### Text formatting

Italics is reserved for titles and legislations, or user input.

Bold is used for emphasis.

Font and text size will be relative to the html due to the nature of markdown.

### Numbers

Use words for one to nine and numerals for 10 and over

For numbers over 999, use a comma for clarity

25,000 or 3,000,000

Unless the number is paired with a symbol

3 cm or 2.75

For complex numbers, use a combination

2.5 million $57,800

### Sentences

The purpose of a sentence is to deliver a single message. The average sentence will have a length of 15-20 words.

A variety of sentence lengths will engage your reader.

Put qualifying phrases, conditions, and explanations into separate sentences.

If you want to elaborate on the same point in a new sentence, use words like &#39;also&#39;, &#39;further&#39;, or &#39;however&#39;.

If there are multiple points in a single sentence, consider using several shorter sentences, dot points, colons, or notes.

Maintain order in paragraphs.

If a sentence establishes an order, explain each item in the same order. This will help with flow and consistency.

Avoid repetition and redundancy.

Aim for lean, efficient, and concise sentences.

## Writing

### Acronyms

Acronyms are useful to simplify a sentence.

If you use an acronym, always spell out the title at first use, followed by the acronym in brackets.

For example:

This is the Quality Assurance (QA) process. For all QA information refer to this article.

### Capitalisation

Capital letters are to be use on proper nouns.

All writing will follow sentence case, including headings.

### Verbs

Verbs should be written in the present tense.

Be consistent with your tense.

### Active voice

Use active voice when you want the writing to be simple, direct, clear, and easy to read.

Active voice emphasises the verb.

Sentences are structured as `subject > verb > object`

Passive voice is used for feedback, preserving a relationship, and when the subject is unknown.

### Avoid nominalisation

Avoid nominalisation as it can distract the reader and make the writing dull or heavy.

Nominalisation is a type of 'abstract noun'. The name of a process, technique, or emotion.

For example:

| **Verb**    | **Nominalisation** |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Complete    | Completion         |
| Introduce   | Introduction       |
| Provide     | Provision          |
| Fail        | Failure            |
| Arrange     | Arrangement        |
| Investigate | Investigation      |
| Use         | utilisation        |

### Punctuation

| **Symbol name**    | **Symbol** | **Main use**                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| _Full stop_        | .          | End a statement or command                     |
| _Question mark_    | ?          | Ends a direct question                         |
| _Exclamation mark_ | !          | Ends an expression of emotion                  |
| _Comma_            | ,          | Separates words and groups of words            |
| _Colon_            | :          | Signals more information to come               |
| _Dash_             | &mdash;    | An informal colon                              |
| _Parentheses_      | ( )        | Enclose extra information                      |
| _Brackets_         | []         | Enclose words by someone other than the author |
| _Apostrophe_       | '          | Shows ownership or a contraction\*             |
| _Hyphen_           | -          | Joins two words to make another word           |
| _Quotation marks_  | " "        | Enclose spoken words                           |

\*Avoid using contractions.

End of sentence punctuation does not need to be included in titles, headings, subheadings, UI titles, and lists.

### Tone

Use a conversational tone.

Avoid contractions.

Get to the point!

Be brief.

Use the Oxford comma.

Edit out the terms 'you can', ' there is', 'there are', and 'there were'.

### Voice

Use second person. For example:

You go to the library.

## Types of writing

### Technical content <!-- WIP -->

When writing technical content, always consider the audience's skill.

Use industry specific terms when writing for a professional audience.

Define technical terms in the context they are referred to.

When appropriate, assume the reader understands the fundamentals. If you are unsure, provide a link to more thorough information.

Use frequently used words where possible.

If a term already exists, do not create a new word/phrase. Use these terms consistently throughout the article, and across Thoth Tech.

### Developers <!-- WIP -->

When writing code examples...

### Writing instructions/steps

Intructions are used when a reader is wanting to learn. Therefore, the steps must be clear, easy to understand, and follow.

Emphasis should be placed on the main direction. Use **bold** to highlight key words or phrases which indicate the action or outcome.

Make sure the reader knows where the action should take place before you describe the action. If necessary, provide an introductory step to highlight the area.

Throughout step-by-step instructions, formating and language must be consistent. Capitalise the first word of full sentences, and full stop at the end.

A separate numbered entry should be used for each step. Each step should be a complete sentence in imperative verb form, including actions that finalise the step.

Limit the number of steps to seven, and fit all steps onto the same screen.

For single-step procedures, follow the same format, but use an unordered list instead of ordered.

When writing simple sequences, you can use `A > B > C` format. However, this should be used sparingly due to accessibility tool limitations.

For example:

**To create a group of tiles:**

1. On the Start screen, select the tiles you want to group together.
1. Drag them to an open space. When a gray bar appears behind them, release the tiles to create the new group.

**To move a group of tiles:**

- On the Start screen, zoom out and drag the group where you want.

## Bias-free communication <!-- WIP -->

Do not use gendered pronouns.

Avoid stereotypes.

Respect diversity.

Be inclusive.

Be conscious about country names.

Do not generalise.

Do not use slang.

Do not use profane/derogatory terms.

Do not use loaded terms, for example, instead of Master and slave, try primary and subordinate.

Focus on people, not disabilities.

## Global communication <!-- WIP -->

Keep it short and simple.

Lists and tables reduce complexity.

Include 'that' and 'who'.

Include 'the'.

Include verbs, if necessary for clarity.

Use sentence capitalisation.

Use active voice.

Avoid linking more than three phrases.

Use one word for a concept.

Avoid -ing and -ed endings.
