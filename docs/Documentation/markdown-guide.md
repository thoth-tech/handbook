# Markdown Guide

## What is Markdown?

Markdown (md) is a markup language, similar to a .txt file, but with basic **in-text** formatiing
elements. Although it can produce similar outputs as a word processor, there are other benefits that Thoth Tech can leverage.

### Thoth Tech and Markdown

Thoth Tech will use Markdown as it default documentation standard.

This decision is based on a number of factors:

1. Widespread acceptance and support
1. Readability
1. Existing products have a md presence
1. GitHub support (**ensuring accountability and transparency**)
1. HTML and static site capability

Many tools are capable of working in Markdown (**Dillinger and VS Code are good starting points**)
