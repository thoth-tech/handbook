## DreamBig

DreamBig is a new product innovation driven by the School of IT at Deakin. DreamBig aims to provide
a personalised roadmap integrated with Ontrack to support students to develop their professional
identity across their course and improve their employability after graduation. In addition, it aims
to provide a platform to help set realistic expectations for students graduating into the real
world. In line with this vision, it is proposed to build a prototype that can help achieve the
following goals:

- Multi-dimensional visualisation of each student's growing professional identity
- Used within curriculum to encourage engagement.
- Scaffolds reflections on industry-readiness
- Increases awareness of important milestones and dates for graduate recruitment and internships
- Customised paths for career starters, career changers and career advancers.

### Prototype Technical Team

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

DreamBig is at its early inception. The customer needs and product requirements are gradually
discovered and refined. The Prototype Technical project is an attempt to explore the technicality
and possibility of the features discovered by the design team. The process includes determining
Backend API functionality and preparing frontend pages to prove that, identifying underserved
customer needs, UML diagram for backend DB design, database, specifying the MVP feature set,
building, and testing small build components of the prototype with the customers.

#### Aims for Trimester

Research will be conducted to investigate finalised frontend components and design the backend for
them and prioritise high-value features. These will form the minimum viable product (MVP). As part
of this work, the following will be established:

- Documentation of app developments
- Research and analysis on prototype backend functionality
- Focusing on connecting frontend to backend upon design conformation
- Complete technical prototype incorporating above analysis

#### Deliverables

Short-term

- Automated database seeding to allow for testing and demonstration purposes
- Research a QA process to be followed when developing new features

Long-term

- Build frontend pages that deliver DreamBig planned functionality
- Ensure all aspects of DreamBig app have been unit tested
- Create e2e tests for DreamBig

What we achieved this trimester

- Detailed Entity Relationship Diagram of backend DB design
- Documentation on how to setup DreamBig app using Docker
- Frontend pages that prove backend API functionality
- Implementation of the DreamBig star component

### Design Team

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

DreamBig Frontend design is at its early inception. The customer needs and product requirements are
discovered and are being refined at every step. The Prototype Design project is an attempt to
explore the product-market fit. The process includes re-determining our target customer, identifying
underserved customer needs, defining the product value proposition, specifying the MVP feature set,
building, and testing design the prototype with the customers.

#### Aims for Trimester

Research will be conducted to investigate customer needs and prioritise high-value features. These
will form the minimum viable product (MVP). As part of this work, the following will be established:

- Work on the UI design for every features
- Work on the UX design for application
- Documentation on simple and clear design

#### Deliverables

Short-term

- Complete high quality design documentation to communicate design concepts.

Long-term

- Keeping updating any users prefer features and UI.

What we achieved this trimester

- Finishing wireframes update and high-quality model.
- Complete a good quality UI/UX design prototype incorporating above analysis.

### DreamBig Documentation and Quality Assurance Team

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

DreamBig Frontend design is at its early inception. The customer needs and product requirements are
discovered and are being refined at every step. The Prototype Documentation and QA project is an
attempt to explore and build a standard structured framework of documentation and QA processes. The
process includes and testing of design/technical prototype with company standards.

#### Aims for Trimester

Research will be conducted to investigate possible structure and frameworks for documentations and
QA testings. These will form the minimum viable product (MVP). As part of this work, the following
will be established:

- Build a framework for documentation and QA testing
- Completed aligning the previous documents to the new framework
- Work on QA testing for existing design features and wireframes and keep doing the same for the
  work that will be completed in the project going forward

#### Deliverables

Short-term

- Once the build of design prototype is done do the required testing
- Once the build of technical prototype (backend, frontend, API, database) is being built, do
  regular testing to see if they are produced according to company standards

What we achieved this trimester

- Complete research and trials of new frameworks for documentation and QA
- Test the framework with new documentation and features for QA Long-term
- Finish converting previous documentation according to the new framework
